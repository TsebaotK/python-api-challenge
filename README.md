# python-api-challenge

In this activity, I created two folders with a WeatherPy and VacationPy Jupyter notebook inside them. 
The WeatherPy has a python script that visualizes the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I wrote a script that creates plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude and Compute the Linear regression for each relationship.
The VacationPy Jupyter notebook has a script that loads the CSV file from the WeatherPy output, imports the python library from the geoViews, and an API from Geoapify. I then wrote a script to create a map that displays a point for each city with humidity as the size of the point and a data frame to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity. Then, that search for the first hotel within 10,000 meters of each city. Finally, the script created a map that gives additional information in the hover message for the hotel name and the country.
